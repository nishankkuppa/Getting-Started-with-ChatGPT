# Getting-Started-with-ChatGPT

This is a simply Python script to use ChatGPT in a conversational manner. This program requires you to enter an API key where it says "YOUR-API-KEY-HERE". So you need to make an OpenAI account and get your API key there.
This program also requires you to have the OpenAI package installed on your machine, which your IDE can do.
